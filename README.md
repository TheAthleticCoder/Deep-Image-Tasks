# **Deep Image Tasks**

**In this repository we apply algorithms such as:**
1. Apply K-Means Clustering on images.
2. Apply Image Compression using PCA.
3. Implementing Gaussian Mixture Models.
4. Using PCA for reconstructing faces.
5. Implementing Hard and Soft Margin SVMs.
6. Implementing MLPs and their variations and performing a detailed analysis.
7. Implemented AutoEncoders of three types:
    1. MLP-Only Model
    2. CNN-Only Model
    3. MLP+CNN Model
8. Experimenting with different parametric variations of the autoencoders.

## **File Structure**

1. `clustering compression` which does K-Means Clustering on images and applies Image Compression using PCA.
2. `GMMs` which implements Gaussian Mixture Models.
3. `reconstructed_faces` which implements PCA for facial reconstruction and recognition. 
4. `Knowing_MLPs.ipynb` which implementsg MLPs and their variations and performing a detailed analysis.
5. `SVM.ipynb` which impements Hard and Soft Margin SVMs.
6. `Let's_Dive_into_CNNs.ipynb` which implements AutoEncoders of the three mentioned types and we perform a deatiled analysis of the same.
